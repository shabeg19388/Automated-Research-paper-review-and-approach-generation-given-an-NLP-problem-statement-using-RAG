Project for Information Retrieval and Web Agents (Spring 2025)

Given any problem statement, researchers typically need to sift through numerous academic papers to
grasp the latest advancements and identify the most efficient solution strategies. This manual review
process is not only labor-intensive and time-consuming but also prone to overlooking emerging
work in niche subfields. Moreover, maintaining and curating a fully filtered dataset of relevant
publications is practically infeasible, given the scale and velocity of new research output. To address
these challenges, we have developed a novel, automated pipeline that leverages semantic retrieval
and summarization techniques to surface the most pertinent papers for a given query. By dynamically
tailoring a detailed, context-aware approach based on these curated insights, our method streamlines
the research discovery phase and empowers users to rapidly converge on the best methodologies for
their specific problem statements
